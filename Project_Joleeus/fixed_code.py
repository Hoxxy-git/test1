Unsanitized input from a web form flows into the return value of login, where it is used to render an HTML page returned to the user. This may result in a Cross-Site Scripting attack (XSS).Check Inputs For Cross-Site ScriptingCheck Inputs For Cross-Site Scripting is finding client-side XSS vulnerabilities.Client-side XSS occurs when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a script, to a browser-based application. It was introduced very early in the history of computer securitysss. This kind of vulnerability basically allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim's browser which can hijack user sessions, def

Unsanitized input from the HTTP request body flows into save, where it is used as a path. This may result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an attacker to write arbitrary files.


payload
This endpoint takes any file that is sent in the request body and saves it to a temporary location in the filesystem. The contents of the file are not validated (may contain '\0' characters, may be binary, may be dangerous) before being written to disk. The filename will have no file extension.


This is a simple read-only save endpoint. In other words, you can send anything in the request body AND you can choose a random file name, so it
